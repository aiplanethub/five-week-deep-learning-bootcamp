### What is Digital Image Processing?

* **Digital Image:** A representation of a two-dimensional image as a finite set of digital values, called picture elements or pixels. _f(x, y)_
* Where x, y are spatial coordinates&#x20;
  * **f(x, y) = i(x,y) \* r(x,y)**
  * f(x, y): Intensity at given point (x, y)
  * i(x, y): Illumination at (x, y)
  * r(x, y): Reflectance/ Transmissivity at (x, y)

### Pixel & Digitization

* Pixels are the elements of a digital image that typically represent gray levels, colours, heights, opacities.
* Digitization implies that a digital image is an approximation of a real scene in the numerical matrices form

### Digital Image

Common digital image formats include

* 1 sample per point (B\&W / Grayscale)
* 3 samples per point ( Red, Green and Blue)
* 4 samples per point (Red, Green, Blue and Alpha / opacity)

### What is Digital Image Processing?

* **Digital Image Processing:** Processing digital images by means of a computer.
* An **image processing** operation typically defines a new image _g_ in terms of an existing image _f._
* We can transform either the range of _f_.

* Or the domain of _f_:

### Why Digital Image Processing?

* Improvement of pictorial information for human interpretation
* Processing of image data for storage, transmission and representation for autonomous machine perception
* Where image processing ends, fields such as image analysis and computer vision start.
* The continuum from image processing to computer vision is broken down into:
  * Low – Level:
    * Inputs and outputs are images
    * Ex: Noise Removal, Image Sharpening
  * Mid – Level:
    * Outputs are the attributes extracted from input images&#x20;
    * Ex: Object Recognition, Image Segmentation
  * High – Level:
    * An ensemble of recognition of individual objects&#x20;
    * Ex: Scene Understanding, Autonomous Navigation
